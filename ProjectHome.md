This project allows you to control your PC with your Android Phone.
Features:
  * Touchpad with keyboard
  * Customizable profiles for easy controlling e.g. your media player
  * Intent receiver for usage with other apps (I will post the details later; see the test application)
  * Easy configuration via QR code

PC client uses [ZXing](http://code.google.com/p/zxing/) library to generate the QR code.
